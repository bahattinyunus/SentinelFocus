## 🌌 The Sentinel Mission
In an era of digital surveillance, **Privacy is the only currency**. SentinelFocus guarantees that your vision, your posture, and your focus remain entirely local. Every pixel is processed within the boundaries of your hardware.

## 🛡️ Level-4 Security Protocols

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **PROTOCOL 01: THE PRIVACY FORTRESS**
> If a second face or unrecognized movement is detected behind the operator, the system activates an immediate `40px Backdrop Blur` across all sensitive application windows.

> [!WARNING]
> **PROTOCOL 02: DISTRACTION KILL-SWITCH**
> Upon detecting a mobile device (`cell phone`) within the primary focus vector, the session is placed in `STASIS MODE`. All work metrics are frozen until the distraction is neutralized.
